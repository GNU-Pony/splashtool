splashtool is a simple tool that lets you create an almost exact
image of how your SYSLINUX bootloader configurations will reader
if you are using vesamenu, so that you can do edits to the
background image and the syslinux.cfg so that you do not need
to use a virtual machine and real machine that you reboot.
